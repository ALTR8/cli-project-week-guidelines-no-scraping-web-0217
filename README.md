# Playlister CLI

In `playlister-rb`, you built a simple domain model for Aritsts, Songs, and Genres. It is now time to make use of that domain model to build an interactive Command Line Jukebox that is populated with data from a folder filled with MP3s.

## Setting Up the Project

First, Fork and Clone this project. Code your answer in an appropriate branch, `solution`, and then submit a Pull Request.

You can run the test suite via `rspec`.

## Objectives

### Setup

The first step of this project is to set it up correctly.

You should be delivering the project with the folder structure and setup we've been learning about and using. It looks something like this:

```
bin/
config/
db/
lib/
 models/ 
spec/
```
